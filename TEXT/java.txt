    Platform independent - We can write Java code in one platform (operating system) and run on another platform without any modification.
    Object-oriented - Java is an object-oriented language. This helps to make our Java code more flexible and reusable.
    Speed - Well optimized Java code is nearly as fast as lower-level languages like C++ and much faster than Python, PHP, etc.
